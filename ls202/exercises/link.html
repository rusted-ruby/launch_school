      The Creating Hyperlinks section of <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/#creating-hyperlinks">Getting to Know HTML</a> discusses
      hyperlinks, or anchors. Be sure to work both "In Practice" sections; they
      pick up from where you left off in an earlier reading assignment.
